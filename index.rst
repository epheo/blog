"You can't unleash new things in closed sources"
================================================

That's with those words in mind that I started this blog in 2008. Although, the original content was in french and original posts aren't referenced here anymore.

I'm a cloud architect and open source enthusiast with insights on OpenShift, OpenStack, Linux, 
and emerging technologies. 

This space is where I aim to share troubleshooting notes, implementation guides, and 
occasional thoughts on technology with a focus on open source solutions 
and cloud infrastructure.
