"You can't unleash new things in closed sources"
================================================

That’s with those words in mind that I started this blog in 2008. Although, the original content was in french and original posts aren’t referenced here anymore.

I'm a cloud architect and open source enthusiast with insights on OpenShift, OpenStack, Linux, 
and emerging technologies. Since 2008, I've been documenting my technical journey, originally in French,
deleting many things along the way, and now sharing my experiences in English.

This space is where I aim to share troubleshooting notes, implementation guides, and 
occasional thoughts on technology with a focus on open source solutions 
and cloud infrastructure.

Areas of Focus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Container Platforms**: OpenShift, Kubernetes
* **Cloud Infrastructure**: OpenStack, Software Defined Networking
* **Linux Systems**: Configuration, optimization

Beyond Tech
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When not immersed in code and cloud architecture, I'm often seeking adventure elsewhere:

* **Skydiving**: Free-falling through the clouds (sometimes competing)
* **Skiing**: Racing down slopes
* **Urban Exploration**: Navigating the hidden network of Paris catacombs

These pursuits, somewhat are very much alike open source development, they involve calculated 
risk, continuous learning, and a community of passionate individuals sharing knowledge and experiences.
