Fine-Tuning Mistral:7b on Red Hat OpenShift Documentation with Hugging Face Tools
=================================================================================

[WIP]

In this blog post, we'll explore how to fine-tune the powerful Mistral:7b LLM, on the 
extensive Red Hat OpenShift documentation using the Hugging Face tools. 

We'll be walking through preprocessing the data, converting it to a format compatible 
with Hugging Face, and fine-tuning the model.

First, let's prepare our data. The Red Hat OpenShift documentation is extensive; we'll 
need to scrape this information and save it in a JSON file for easier processing.

Next, we'll convert the preprocessed data into tokens that can be used to fine tune our 
model. 

We'll utilize the Datasets library provided by Hugging Face to load your data and 
transform it into a format compatible with Transformers.

This is the library we'll use later to fine-tune our model.

Now comes the exciting part - fine-tuning Mistral:7b! To do this, we'll need to provide 
a few pieces of information to Hugging Face: the trained model checkpoint (Mistral:7b), 
our preprocessed dataset, and hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and 
number of epochs.


The following code snippet demonstrates how to fine-tune Mistral:7b on a dataset using 
Hugging Face tools:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Import the required libraries
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer
    import datasets
    import torch
    
    # Load preprocessed dataset
    dataset = datasets.load_dataset('local_file', data_files='path/to/your/data.json')
    
    # Define the tokenizer and model
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistral-7b")
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("mistral-7b", num_labels=2)
    
    # Define the training arguments
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir='./results',         # Output directory
        num_train_epochs=3,             # Total number of training epochs
        per_device_train_batch_size=16, # Per device batch size during training
        warmup_steps=500,               # Number of warmup steps for learning rate scheduler.
        weight_decay=0.01,              # Strength of weight decay
    )
    
    # Define the Trainer
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,                          # The instantiated ðŸ¤— Transformers Model to be trained
        args=training_args,                   # Training arguments, defined above
        train_dataset=dataset['train'],       # Training dataset
    )
    
    # Fine-tune the model
    trainer.train()

# Save the fine-tuned model checkpoint
model.save_pretrained('./my_finetuned_model')
