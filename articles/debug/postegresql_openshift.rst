Introduction
-----------

This article describes how to fix a common PostgreSQL issue in OpenShift when the database enters a crash loop
with a "tuple concurrently updated" error. This problem typically occurs due to an unclean shutdown of the
PostgreSQL server, leaving the database in an inconsistent state.

Understanding the Error
----------------------

When starting a PostgreSQL pod in OpenShift, you might encounter the following error:

.. code-block:: none

   pg_ctl: another server might be running; trying to start server anyway
   waiting for server to start....LOG:  redirecting log output to logging 
   collector process
   HINT:  Future log output will appear in directory "pg_log".
   ..... done
   server started
   => sourcing /usr/share/container-scripts/postgresql/start/set_passwords.sh ...
   ERROR:  tuple concurrently updated

This error indicates that PostgreSQL has detected an issue with its internal data consistency.
The "tuple concurrently updated" message suggests that a database tuple (row) was modified by multiple processes
simultaneously, leaving the database in an inconsistent state.

Step-by-Step Solution
--------------------

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Find the problematic PostgreSQL pod**

   First, locate the PostgreSQL pod that is stuck in the crash loop.

2. **Start a debug session**

   Use the OpenShift command-line tool to start a debug session with the pod:

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc debug pod/<postgres-pod-name>

3. **Scale down the deployment**

   In another terminal, scale the associated PostgreSQL deployment to zero pods:

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc scale deployment/<postgres-deployment-name> --replicas=0

4. **Run the PostgreSQL startup script**

   From the debug session terminal, run the PostgreSQL startup script:

   .. code-block:: bash

      run-postgresql

   This creates necessary configuration files that will allow you to manage the PostgreSQL server.
   You should see the same error output described above.

5. **Stop PostgreSQL cleanly**

   Stop the PostgreSQL server with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/pgsql/data/userdata

   Expected output:

   .. code-block:: none

      waiting for server to shut down.... done
      server stopped

6. **Start PostgreSQL manually**

   Start the PostgreSQL server manually to check if it initializes correctly:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/pgsql/data/userdata

   Expected output:

   .. code-block:: none

      server starting
      LOG:  redirecting log output to logging collector process
      HINT:  Future log output will appear in directory "pg_log".

   The server should remain running without errors.

7. **Stop PostgreSQL cleanly again**

   Ensure a clean shutdown by stopping PostgreSQL:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/pgsql/data/userdata

   Expected output:

   .. code-block:: none

      waiting for server to shut down.... done
      server stopped

8. **Exit the debug session**

   Type `exit` to leave the debug session.

9. **Scale up the deployment**

   Finally, scale the PostgreSQL deployment back up:

   .. code-block:: bash

      oc scale deployment/<postgres-deployment-name> --replicas=1

   The PostgreSQL pod should now start normally without crashing.

Why This Works
-------------

This procedure works because it:

1. Allows PostgreSQL to perform a clean shutdown, ensuring all data is properly written
2. Clears any potentially corrupted transaction logs
3. Creates the necessary configuration files needed for proper operation
4. Eliminates race conditions that might occur during the container's normal startup process

If you encounter this issue frequently with a particular PostgreSQL deployment, consider investigating:

- Storage performance issues
- Abrupt pod terminations
- Resource constraints causing timeouts during shutdown
- Improper backup procedures
